# ApkLab — Technical requirements

## Proposed stack
Flutter · Kotlin + C/C++ (Android Native Backend) · SQLite

## Architecture
- Separate presentation, state, and data boundaries.
- Validate all external input before use.
- Reserve layout space for loading content and media.
- Keep secrets out of the client bundle.

## Data model
| Entity | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| User input | Captures the primary workflow input. |
| Result | Stores or returns the validated outcome. |
| Settings | Holds user-visible preferences. |

## Delivery checklist
- Responsive layouts and accessible controls.
- Error, empty, and loading states.
- Instrumented primary workflow.
- Documented deployment and rollback process.
